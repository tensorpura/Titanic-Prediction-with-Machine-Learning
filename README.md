The Titanic dataset project uses over 10 machine learning models to fit and analyze passenger data, ultimately achieving a prediction accuracy of over 85% in understanding survival factors.

Machine Learning Models:

KNeighborsClassifier (with 3 neighbors)

SVC (Support Vector Classifier with probability enabled)

DecisionTreeClassifier

XGBClassifier (eXtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier)

RandomForestClassifier (with 100 estimators and a max feature count of 3)

AdaBoostClassifier (Adaptive Boosting Classifier)

GradientBoostingClassifier

GaussianNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)

LinearDiscriminantAnalysis

QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis

LogisticRegression
