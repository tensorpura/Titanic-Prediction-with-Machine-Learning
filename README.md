The Titanic dataset project uses over 10 machine learning models to fit and analyze passenger data, ultimately achieving a prediction accuracy of over 85% in understanding survival factors.

Machine Learning Models:

KNeighborsClassifier (with 3 neighbors)
SVC (Support Vector Classifier with probability enabled)
DecisionTreeClassifier
XGBClassifier (eXtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier)
RandomForestClassifier (with 100 estimators and a max feature count of 3)
AdaBoostClassifier (Adaptive Boosting Classifier)
GradientBoostingClassifier
GaussianNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)
LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis
LogisticRegression
